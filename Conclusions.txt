Observable trends from randomly selected cities based on lat, lon for: a) temp, b) humidity, c) cloudiness and d) wind speed:

a) Not surprisingly, there is a clear relationship between between Latitude and max temperature. The closer you are to latitute zero,
the higher the temperature gets. In addition, the cities with positive Latitude (Northern Hemisphere) their weather starts decreasing,
since our current date (early March), we are currently transition from winter to spring. By contrast cities with negative latitude
(Southern Hemisphere) are transitining from summer to winter. In addition, the more you move out from the equator, the lower the 
temperature gets. 

b) For humidity plot, there seems to be no clear relationship between Latitute and % humidity. However, it seems that most cities (~80%),
independent of Latitude, experience humidity between 40% to 100% and ~98% of cities have humidity beween 20% and 100%. In addition,
there seems to be no clear relationship between Latitude and % cloudiness. But most of the data (~65%) seems to cluster between no cloudiness
and and more than 75% cloudinees. The remaining % of cloudiness from cities falls in between.

c) Wind speed by citiies doesn't seem to be any significant correlation by Latitude. Nevertheless, there seems to appear a peak in wind speed at
in certain cities close to latitude 60 and -60, which seems to fit with wind speed and the effect earth rotation has on them (ie. easterlies and 
westerlies)
